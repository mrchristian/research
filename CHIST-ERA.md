# Publishing Computational Research and Open Science Publishing

## Presentation abstract

Simon Worthington, March 2020

CHIST-ERA workshop on Open Science in transnational research, Friday 6 March 2020, Swiss National Science Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.

'The best way to predict the future is to invent it' – Alan Kay, 1972 Xerox PARC

The 'computational publication' is now becoming a technical reality as a response to the problems Open Science is trying to solve, such as — replicability, reproducibility — by providing real-time access to software, code, and data in research publishing such as in editors like Jupyter Notebook, or as ‘runtime environment’ content packages such as the o2r project. (Konkol, Nüst, and Goulier 2020) I quote Alan Kay here as the model of digitally connected publications with simulations embedded is now new, it's half a century old, but it's taken this long to become a reality. Kay published his 'Dynabook' research paper in 1972. (Kay 1972)

The 'computational publication' in one instantiation of Open Science Publishing and can be used to see what infrastructure is needed to support this type of research publishing and collaborative working — which is digitally connected to the whole research cycle.

So what is needed to support the 'computational publication' and what is on the horizon for research infrastructures? Here is a sample list of associated Open Science Publishing areas, products, projects, and initiatives: Jupyter Notebook/computational papers, Open Research Knowledge Graph, data mining and open APIs (ContentMine), TIB AV Portal, Vivo, Infrastructure as Code/Terraform, and Containerized publications/o2r/PopperCI, etc.
